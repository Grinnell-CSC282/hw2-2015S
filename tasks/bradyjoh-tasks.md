2-3 Tasks here:

Not hard, but something I didn't know how to do:

1. Generate a PGP key with 'gpg', send a signed message to someone, and encrypt a file with someone else's public PGP key. 

2. Back up all files in a directory to an FTP site, to another computer over SSH, or to a different directory or hard drive. Schedule this to occur on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. 
I thought of having this work by using cron jobs for scheduling and rsync for the actual transfer. 

3. Create a file in your home directory that can be read and modified by anyone so they can say hello.
