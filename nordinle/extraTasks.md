# Some Extra Tasks:

1. In an html file replace all instances of
```html
<h1> ... </h1>
``` 
with an appropriately sized 
markdown header.

Solution:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

2. Print this to stdout with one line of code and no artistic ability.
```
 _____________ 
< hello world >
 ------------- 
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
Solution:
`cowsay "hello world"`

Delete every third word in a text file.

Solution: I can think of how one could do this with C but I know of no 
unix utils to do it.
